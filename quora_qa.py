answers = ["""As I write this answer, I'm sitting in a computer lab. My AP Seminar students are working on their group presentations, so I have a few free moments. In fact, we've all agreed that I'm not supposed to bother them during this time. Once I start lecturing, I have a habit of eating up all of their lab time.
This class is very strange for me in that it randomly happens to be all female and one male. Fifteen girls, one boy, and me in a room. How many of these girls are "beautiful?" I couldn't tell you. I don't notice. I don't care. They're children.""",
"""I taught high school.  There were a few female students that could probably be objectively defined as beautiful by their peers and others.  Did not care.
Here is this thing: As someone who is a product of the USA educational system on training teachers, you get a certain degree of indoctrination that students are not sexual objects. (If you need context for American attitudes, remember American television shows get censored for violence but our more sexually graphic cable shows are aired on free to air television with the sex bits not being filtered in other countries.) Children are not sexual objects.  If you see people treating children as sexual objects, you should report this behavior and have a legal obligation to do so.  Children are not sexual objects.  You should not touch them.  You should not hug them.  While you can to a certain extent be their friend, you are still not their friend. Children are not sexual objects.  You should not hug them or touch them.  It is a message that becomes pretty ingrained, especially given the legal obligations regarding reporting of abuse.""",
"""There is a rush of possibilities running through my head. I am nearing my 20th year in juvenile correctional education. My students (from 12-20 years of age) are locked up, mostly for crimes and/or probation violations involving drugs and/or gangs. I hear potentially infuriating comments daily.
It’s not whether my students say, ”fuck” in my class, but how often, to whom, in what tone, and whether the context is intellectually or academically relevant.""",
"""I heard this from my college classmate: "I don't have the money to buy the book for this class". I normally wouldn't be infuriated if this book was really expensive, but it cost only $0.99 for tangible paperback book!
We had a great teacher, who was very considerate about our budgets, and he intentionally selected the most inexpensive materials and used to provide us with additional PDF materials, even free audio books in case we didn't want to buy a copy. I was really sorry for our teacher.""",
"""You try to make experience unique, as you not planning for divorce and do it again and again. So what would be the country you will never go under normal circunstancies? Afghanistan and Somalia come to my mind, but that is not very safe, might be your very last trip indeed so skip these two. Than couple of countries: Mongolia and Bhutan. You, surely will never go to Mongolia in your life, not even in weird dreams, good choice. Bhutan is much more interesting possibility as country itself, but taking into account that yearly all country has about 12,000 tourists (Like Niagara Falls in 5 hours) chances to go to Bhutan basically zero."""]
